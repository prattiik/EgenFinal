# EgenFinal

The has the EgenFinal project - Realtime streaming API data in GCP

I have used cryptocurrency and weather real-time streaming API data. The project architecture diagram is in the egen_final_projectarchitecture directory. 
The GCP infrastructure for this project screenshots is in egen_final_project_gcp_screenshots. The crypto_files has the cloud composer [airflow dag] file, cloud function file, requirement.txt and docker file. All these files are used to fetch and transforming the data from cryptocurrency API. The weather_files has the cloud composer [airflow dag] file, cloud function file, requirement.txt and docker file. All these files are used to fetch and transforming the data from the weather API.
